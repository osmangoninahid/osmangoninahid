I have **over 10 years of experience** building software from the ground up and scaling it to serve millions of users. Out of those 10 years, **8+ were spent working in startups**, where I collaborated closely with business leaders, management, and C-level executives to drive growth through technology.

I’ve worked closely with product teams to translate business needs into **clear, actionable product requirements**, making it easier for the tech teams to understand and implement them quickly.

I’m passionate about **UX** and always prioritize it. I’ve worked with UX designers to enhance **accessibility** and **simplify user experiences**, pushing for designs that are intuitive and user-friendly.

I’m also familiar with both **web and mobile frontend technologies**, having worked with them in the past. This allows me to support frontend teams and offer guidance on improving and troubleshooting issues.

I’ve **hired, built, and led highly productive cross-functional teams** of various sizes, with **6 years of experience in leadership**, understanding different mindsets, and maximizing resources to get the best out of people.

Primarily, I’m a **Backend Engineer** with **extensive experience designing and building highly available and performant microservices**, whether it’s **HTTP/REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, or gRPC**. I’ve also worked with **XMPP** and have knowledge of core XEPs. I have **8+ years of experience with NodeJs** and **5+ years with Python** and related frameworks, and I’m familiar with **Golang and Erlang**.

I write **Kubernetes/Terraform configurations** and deploy services to the cloud, with or without containerization. I’ve **scaled microservices to handle millions of concurrent users**, and I’m always up for tackling new challenges in scalability.

Lately, I’m interested in learning more about **Distributed Systems** and **MLOps** to broaden my expertise further.
